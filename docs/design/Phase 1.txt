Show thinking
Of course! This is an exciting and well-thought-out concept for a game. I can definitely help you bring "Biome Weavers" to life. The game design document and the phased roadmap you've provided are excellent starting points.

Let's follow your roadmap and begin with Phase 1: Pre-Production & Technical Foundation. The best place to start is by building a "Gray Box" Prototype. This will help us create a simple, playable version of the game to test the core mechanics before we add any detailed art or complex server logic.

Overview of the Solution: The "Gray Box" Prototype
Our goal is to create a functional prototype using the Phaser 3 game engine. This prototype will focus entirely on the core gameplay loop for a single player in "The Whispering Woods":


Player Movement: A simple rectangle representing Lila will be able to run and jump.
Essence Objects: We'll create "Source" objects for the "Bouncy" and "Sticky" essences.
Faded Objects: We'll have gray platforms and walls that Lila can interact with.
Essence Weaving: We will implement the Absorb and Imbue mechanics. 
Lila can touch a "Source" to absorb its essence.
She can then press a key to imbue that essence into a nearby "Faded" object, changing its properties.
This prototype will not include multiplayer features or final artwork yet. As your roadmap suggests, it's crucial to get the core, single-player mechanics feeling right first.

Code and Implementation Instructions
Here is the complete code for the "Gray Box" prototype. It's broken into two files: index.html (the webpage that holds the game) and game.js (the JavaScript code that runs the game).

1. index.html
This file sets up the webpage and includes the Phaser 3 library from a Content Delivery Network (CDN), so you don't have to download it.

This is the core logic of our prototype. It defines the game scene, creates the player and objects, and handles all the game mechanics.

How to Run the Prototype
Create a Project Folder: Create a new folder on your computer named biome-weavers-prototype.
Save the Files:
Save the first block of code as index.html inside that folder.
Save the second block of code as game.js inside the same folder.
Run a Local Server: For security reasons, modern browsers often restrict loading files directly from your computer. You'll need a simple local server to run the game.
If you have Node.js installed: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder (cd path/to/biome-weavers-prototype), and run the command npx http-server.
If you have Python installed: Use the command python -m http.server.
If you use VS Code: You can install the "Live Server" extension, right-click on index.html, and choose "Open with Live Server".
Play the Game: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or the address provided by your local server). You should see the game running!
You now have a playable prototype that proves the core gameplay is fun. You can run, jump, absorb essences from the colored squares, and imbue them into the gray objects to change their behavior.

This is the perfect foundation for Phase 2, where we'll replace these gray boxes with beautiful art and begin implementing the puzzle and narrative logic.
