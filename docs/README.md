## 📝 Document Conventions

### File Naming
- **PascalCase** for major documents: `GameDesignDocument.md`
- **kebab-case** for specific features: `essence-system-design.md`
- **Phase N.txt** for development phases
- **descriptive-names** for all others

### Content Structure
- Start with clear objectives
- Include implementation details
- Reference related documents
- Update status and completion

## 🔄 Document Lifecycle

1. **Draft** - Initial ideas and concepts
2. **Review** - Team feedback and iteration
3. **Approved** - Finalized for implementation
4. **Living** - Updated during development
5. **Archived** - Historical reference

## 🎮 Game Development Context

These documents chart the journey from initial concept to production-ready multiplayer game:

1. **Concept Phase** → Core game idea and mechanics
2. **Planning Phase** → Technical architecture and roadmap  
3. **Prototype Phase** → Proof of concept development
4. **Production Phase** → Full feature implementation
5. **Launch Phase** → Deployment and iteration

Each phase builds upon the previous, maintaining a playable, testable build throughout development.
